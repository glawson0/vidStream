  %h1.title About More Like This
  %p.sub How do you find more videos like your favorites?
  %h1 What is More Like This?
  %p More Like This is a way to find videos like ones you already like.
  %h1 How is this any different from Youtube's recomendations?
  %p More Like This gives you the option to break recomendations into channels. This way you can keep video criteria seperate across channels. Additionally MLT uses different criteria for judging videos than YouTube.
  %h1 How do I use this?
  %p Make an account, grab some urls of your favorite videos, click the create streams button on the streams page and put those links there. Urls need to be comma seperated. from there just watch the new videos and like/dislike them as they come.
  %h1 Why is this showing me the same video
  %p Slow down! Repeated requests for new videos at specific times can cause problems and your request for a new video won't be proccesed quick enough. Wait 5-10 seconds and you should have a new video.
